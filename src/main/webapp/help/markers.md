## Marker sets overview
Markers are curated to represent key cell types and states observed across skin and appendage datasets.

## Tissue-specific markers
Markers highlight region-specific programs, including epidermis, dermis, appendage, and immune compartments.

## Disease-state markers
Disease-associated markers are annotated to support comparative studies between healthy and diseased tissues.

## How markers are curated
Markers are selected from published references and validated against scSAID datasets for consistency.
