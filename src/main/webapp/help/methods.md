## Sample inclusion
Datasets are screened for relevance to skin or appendage tissues, with clear experimental metadata and reproducible processing steps.

## Quality control
Cells are filtered using standard thresholds for gene counts, mitochondrial content, and library complexity to reduce technical artifacts.

## Normalization
Expression values are normalized to account for sequencing depth and batch effects before downstream analysis and visualization.

## Integration strategy
Datasets are integrated using a consistent workflow to enable cross-study comparisons while preserving biological variation.
