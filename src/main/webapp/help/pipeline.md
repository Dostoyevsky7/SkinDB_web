## Pipeline overview
Each dataset is processed through a standardized pipeline that covers preprocessing, clustering, and downstream analyses.

## Preprocessing
Raw counts are filtered, normalized, and scaled to ensure comparability across studies.

## Clustering
Cells are clustered using a consistent parameter set to support reliable cross-study comparisons.

## Differential expression
Differential expression analysis highlights genes enriched in each cluster and condition.

## Visualization outputs
UMAP embeddings and summary plots are generated for interactive exploration in the web interface.
